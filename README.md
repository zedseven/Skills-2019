# Skills-2019

## Basic Information
This is the source code for the Collingwood Collegiate Institute Robotics Club autonomous robot for the Skills Canada 2019 robotics competition.

For this competition we used [VEX Robotics V5](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/v5) to build our robot, and the [PROS IDE](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/) to program it, since VEX Coding Studio is limited and terrible to use.

The problem spec is [here](http://www.skillsontario.com/index.php?p=download&file=936).

## Code
The file `old.cpp` is a copy of the old VCS file, `main.cpp`.

A copy of the entire old VCS project is `VisionTest1.vex`.
